Walt and Jesse try to dispose of the two bodies in the RV, which becomes increasingly complicated when one of them, Krazy-8, wakes up. They eventually imprison him in Jesse's basement. Meanwhile, Skyler grows suspicious of Walter's recent behavior, and they learn that Skyler will deliver a baby girl. Jesse disposes of the body of the other dealer, Emilio Koyama, using hydrofluoric acid as per Walt's instructions, but ignores Walt's warning to use a plastic bin and instead destroys his bathtub in the process.
