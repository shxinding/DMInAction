Walt cannot decide whether or not to kill Krazy-8. Meanwhile, Marie believes that Walter Jr. is smoking marijuana and asks Hank to scare him straight. Walt brings Krazy-8 something to eat, but things turn bad when Walt collapses while descending the steps into the basement. When Walt wakes up, he tells Krazy-8 that he has lung cancer and they start talking about unexpected things they have in common. Eventually, Walt decides to release Krazy-8 but, while disposing of the shards of a broken plate, he sees that a shard is missing and realizes Krazy-8 has concealed it to use as a weapon against him. Feigning his release, Walt confronts Krazy-8 with this information and is immediately attacked; he subsequently garrottes his prisoner in self-defense.
